## Features

- Connect to the HyperSDK blockchain using different signer types (Metamask Snap, Ephemeral, Private Key).
- Fetch and manage account balances.
- Execute read-only actions and transactions.
- Encode and decode data using the ABI (Application Binary Interface).

## Installation

npm install hypersdk-client
```

## Example Usage

To use the HyperSDK Client, make sure you have the latest version installed. You can refer to the JavaScript examples in the [HyperSDK Starter](https://github.com/ava-labs/hypersdk-starter) repository for more detailed usage. Please note that the API and features are evolving rapidly, and there may be frequent changes. The v1.0 release is expected to stabilize the user experience.
